        <strong>Beasts:</strong> In China, Japan and Korea, legendary beasts existed within folktales that were not just as tall tales but stories to warn and delight the unsuspecting audience. These creatures were sometimes dangerous but often merely of another world and could be properly dealt with safely if one knew what to do when in the presence of one. Such fables spread far and wide and were passed down to this day, often becoming part of the local history and national symbols as well.

      <div class="accordion-body">
        <strong>Beings:</strong> In addition to beasts, there were beings, such as spirits, ghosts, semi-human or even local deities that existed. These beings often appeared fully human and could trick people into believing they were in need of help and sometimes mingled in society or even inter-married with humans as well.

        <strong>Events:</strong> Many myths were stories of one-off events such as creation but there were also folktales that retold recurring events, usually where these beasts and beings interacted with humanity. These stories tend to follow a pattern and serve as warnings to inform people how they could escape harm or in very lucky cases, gain some sort of gift for pleasing the deity.
